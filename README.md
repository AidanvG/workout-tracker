# <u> Workout Tracker </u>

The aim of this project is to create a workout tracking tool that people can use to create custom
workout plans. Users will be able to create workouts with whatever custom exercises they like, 
document the number of sets and repetitions they do for each exercise in the workout and change or 
remove exercises or workouts.

Data will be stored in a Postgresql database and interacted with through an API. I would also like
to be able to build some sort of UI using React if I have enough time.
